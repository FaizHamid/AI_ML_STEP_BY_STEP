    "## Overview  \n",
    "* In this project, you will build a text-based adventure game using Python and GitHub Copilot.\n",
    "* The game will allow users to explore different locations, make choices, and complete a \n",
    "simple quest, focusing on fundamental Python concepts such as variables, lists, loops, \n",
    "conditionals, and functions.\n",
    "* You will use GitHub Copilot to assist in writing functions and \n",
    "improving code efficiency.\n",
    "* By completing this project, you will reinforce core Python skills in a fun and interactive way. \n",
    " \n",
    "## Tool: \n",

    "## Situation  \n",
    "* You are a Python programmer looking to practice writing functions and working with conditionals. \n",
    "* You decide to create a text-based adventure game where users explore different locations, encounter challenges, and complete a quest.\n",
    "* You will use GitHub Copilot to help generate and refine your code to speed up development.\n",
    "* The final product should be an interactive command-line interface (CLI) where players can make choices and navigate the game world.\n",
    " \n",
    "## Tasks and actions  \n",
    "* In this adventure game, the player takes on the role of an explorer searching for a legendary treasure hidden in an ancient land. \n",
    "* The player must navigate through various challenges, make strategic decisions, and overcome obstacles to complete their quest successfully.\n",
    "* The game consists of multiple decision-based scenarios where each choice leads to a different outcome.\n",
    "* Some choices will move the player closer to the treasure, while others might result in failure or setbacks.\n",
    "* The player will navigate different locations - \n",
    "   * such as a dense forest and a mysterious cave \n",
    "   * while making strategic choices that determine their success. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps \n",
    "1. The game starts by introducing the player's quest and asking for their name. \n",
    "2. The player is given an initial choice of exploring different paths (a dark forest or a mysterious cave). \n",
    "3. Each choice will trigger a new event, leading to more decisions. \n",
    "4. The player must think critically and choose wisely to advance toward the treasure. \n",
    "5. The game ends in one of the following three ways: \n",
    "   * Winning: Finding the treasure \n",
    "   * Losing: Making a poor decision that ends the adventure \n",
    "   * Restarting: Choosing to replay the game after an unsuccessful attempt \n",
    " \n",
    "The objective is to find the treasure by making the right choices and overcoming obstacles, \n",
    "successfully navigating the adventure. If the player makes poor decisions, they may lose \n",
    "their way or fail the quest. \n",
    " \n",
    "### Task 1: Set up the project \n",
    "Actions: \n",
    "   * Open VS Code and create a new folder for your project \n",
    "   * Inside the folder, create a new Python file named adventure_game.py \n",
    "   * Add an inline comment to describe the purpose of the script \n",
    "   * Run a simple print statement to confirm that the setup is working \n",
    " \n",
    "### Task 2: Create a function to start the game \n",
    "Actions: \n",
    "   * Define the function start_game() to display the game introduction \n",
    "   * Ask the player for their name and store it in a variable \n",
    "   * Provide the player with an initial choice (explore a forest or enter a cave) \n",
    "   * Use GitHub Copilot to generate the function body \n",
    " \n",
    "### Task 3: Create the forest path \n",
    "Actions: \n",
    "   * Define the function forest_path() that describes the forest scenario \n",
    "   * Provide the player with choices (follow a river or climb a tree) \n",
    "   * Use an if-else structure to handle player choices"
